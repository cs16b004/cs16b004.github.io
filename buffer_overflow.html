<p>An overflowing text on buffer overflow attacks.</p>
<p><strong>What is a buffer overflow attack?</strong>
An attack where the attacker has control over your program, your EIP (Instruction Pointer Register) by corrupting memory
can be labelled as buffer overflow attack. Readers can stop here if they feel this is enough:). Please note such attacks mostly 
happen on programs compiled from C/C++ as they provide programmers to access any region of program memory without any checks.</p>
<p>C/C++ programs run in the free world!</p>
<p>To understand how one can take control, we first need to understand how a <code>compiled</code> program sees memory and how function calls take place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A process (running program) sees memory as contiguous region of bytes, labelled from 0 to some arbitrary size set by OS overlords. 
    <ul>
      <li>Physically they might not be contiguous, they are organized into pages and are logically mapped to appear continuous.</li>
      <li><img src="images/rocess_mem.png" alt=""></li>
      <li>the <code>.text</code> section has your compiled code, <code>.data</code> has string and other constants, <code>.bss</code> section to keep static and global variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
